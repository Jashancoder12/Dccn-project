# NetMonitor
Net Monitor is a simple and intuitive web-based tool designed to help users monitor their internet connection in real-time. It provides insights into the network performance by measuring **Ping**, **Download Speed**, and **Upload Speed**, enabling users to quickly detect issues and understand their connection quality.

## Features

- **Ping Test**: Measures the response time of your connection to a server.
- **Download Speed Test**: Determines how fast data can be downloaded from the internet.
- **Upload Speed Test**: Determines how fast data can be uploaded to the internet.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track network performance over time.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-read results for all levels of users.

## Components

### 1. Ping
Ping measures the **latency** of your network connection. It is the time (in milliseconds) it takes for a small data packet to travel from your device to a server and back. A lower ping value indicates a more responsive connection, which is especially important for activities like gaming, video calls, and live streaming.

### 2. Download Speed
Download speed measures how quickly data can be **retrieved from the internet** to your device, typically expressed in Mbps (Megabits per second). Higher download speeds allow faster loading of websites, streaming of videos without buffering, and quicker downloading of files.

### 3. Upload Speed
Upload speed measures how quickly data can be **sent from your device** to the internet. This is important for activities such as uploading files, sending emails with attachments, video conferencing, and cloud backups. Like download speed, it is usually measured in Mbps.

## How It Works
The Net Monitor tool runs tests to measure each component separately, displaying the results in an easy-to-read format. It provides users with a clear understanding of their internet connection's performance and reliability.
